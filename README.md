# Redux Feedback Loop

> **PLEASE COMMENT YOUR CODE.** Do not clone this repository. Instead, download the zip, extract the contents, `git init`, `git add .`, `git commit -m "initial commit - base project"` and add your remote. Please do this before you leave for the day.

"And my last reminder of the day, which is my last reminder of every day, is...?" - Luke


 For this assignment, you will be creating a feedback form modeled after Prime's system. Feedback will be collected over 4 views, and when all steps are complete, your app will save the feedback in the database. In a separate view, a user will be able to see all the collected feedback. 

### SETUP

Create your database and tables using the provided `data.sql` file. Start the server.

```
- Update this README.md to describe the project in your own words
- Improve the styling of the app using Material-UI theme, cards, snackbars, buttons, nav bar, and icons, and anything else you'd like.
- Add the ability to flag an existing feedback entry for further review on the /admin view
- Deploy your project to Heroku -- you'll need to read the special instructions for building and deploying with these apps! 


> NOTE: These stretch goals are intended to be completed in order.
